The BOAT was a mecanum-wheel autonomous robot that served in the 2022 Mechatronics competition. The BOAT2 is its spiritual successor.

The foundation of the BOAT2 will work with the following:
    - A pre-built chassis featuring metal frame
    - 4 motors with mecanum wheels
    - Power distribution board + 2 H-bridges to provide power to all components of the system from a LiPo battery
    - Raspberry Pi Pico acting as the drive controller
    - Radio receiver for receiving commands from a wireless transmitter (remote controller)
    - Raspberry Pi 4 as the primary brain

This foundation can be greatly-expanded on if desired with devices such as a camera, IMU, etc.
